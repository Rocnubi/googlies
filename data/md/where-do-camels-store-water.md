  Contrary to popular belief, camels don't store water in their humps - they store fat. 
  They have special adaptations in their blood cells and body tissues to conserve water.

# Where Do Camels Store Water?

Despite common misconceptions, camels don't actually store water in their humps. Instead, they have evolved several fascinating biological mechanisms to survive in harsh desert environments with limited water access.

## The Truth About Camel Humps

The iconic humps on a camel's back are actually repositories of fatty tissue, not water. These fat stores can weigh up to 80 pounds and serve as:
- Energy reserves during food scarcity
- Natural insulation against extreme temperatures
- Source of metabolic water when broken down

## How Camels Actually Conserve Water

Camels have developed remarkable adaptations to maintain hydration:

1. **Blood Cells**
   - Oval-shaped red blood cells that can swell up to 240% without bursting
   - Continue functioning normally even when body water content drops significantly

2. **Body Temperature Regulation**
   - Can tolerate body temperature fluctuations from 93°F to 107°F
   - Reduces water loss through sweating

3. **Efficient Kidneys and Liver**
   - Produce highly concentrated urine
   - Minimize water waste during waste elimination
   - Reabsorb water from food during digestion

4. **Nasal Passages**
   - Special nasal passages recapture water vapor from exhaled breath
   - Reduces respiratory water loss

## Water Consumption Capabilities

When water is available, camels demonstrate extraordinary drinking abilities:
- Can drink up to 30 gallons of water in just 13 minutes
- Body tissues can rapidly absorb and store water
- Can survive water loss of up to 25% of body weight

## Behavioral Adaptations

Beyond physical adaptations, camels also exhibit behavioral traits that help conserve water:
- Seeking shade during peak heat
- Traveling at night when temperatures are cooler
- Eating succulent plants when available
- Staying inactive during extreme heat

## Comparison with Other Desert Animals

While camels are the most well-known desert survivors, their water conservation methods differ from other desert-adapted animals:
- Desert tortoises store water in their bladders
- Kangaroo rats get water from metabolizing dry seeds
- Desert lizards absorb moisture through their skin

Understanding these adaptations helps explain how camels can survive up to two weeks without water in harsh desert conditions, making them perfectly suited for their environment.

Look for these options in the article editor and fill them out as needed.

## Syncing with GitHub

After saving or creating an article:

1. Googlies will automatically sync your changes with the configured GitHub repository.
2. A new Markdown file will be created (for new articles) or updated (for edits) in the `data/md/` directory of your repository.
3. The `articles.json` file in the `data/json/` directory will also be updated to reflect the changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Saving**: Save your work frequently to prevent loss of content.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent style across your articles for a professional look.
3. **Optimized Titles and Descriptions**: Write clear, SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.
4. **Image Optimization**: If including images, ensure they are optimized for web use.
5. **Proofreading**: Always proofread your articles before publishing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while managing articles:

1. **Changes Not Saving**: Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists, try refreshing the page and re-entering your changes.
2. **Formatting Issues**: If your Markdown isn't rendering correctly, double-check your syntax.
3. **Sync Errors**: If changes aren't reflecting in GitHub, verify your GitHub token permissions and repository settings.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively manage articles on your Googlies website through the admin panel. Remember, all your content is version-controlled through GitHub, allowing for easy tracking of changes and the ability to revert if necessary.
