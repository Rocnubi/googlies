# Where Does Kiwi Fruit Come From?

Despite its strong association with New Zealand, the kiwi fruit's story begins in the Yangtze River Valley of ancient China. Originally known as "yang tao" or "Chinese gooseberry," this fuzzy fruit has traveled across continents to become one of the world's most popular fruits.
