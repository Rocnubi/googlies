# Where Was Chicken Manchurian Invented?

Chicken Manchurian, despite its name suggesting Chinese origins, was actually created in Mumbai, India. This popular Indo-Chinese fusion dish has an interesting origin story that showcases the beautiful blend of culinary cultures.

## The Inventor

Nelson Wang, a Chinese-origin chef working in Mumbai, is credited with inventing Chicken Manchurian in 1975. Wang worked at the prestigious Cricket Club of India when he created this revolutionary dish that would become a cornerstone of Indo-Chinese cuisine.

## The Creation Story

The story goes that one day, a customer at the Cricket Club of India asked Wang to create something different from the usual Chinese dishes. Using his culinary creativity, Wang:

1. Started with basic Indian ingredients
2. Applied Chinese cooking techniques
3. Created a unique sauce using soy sauce, cornstarch, and Indian spices
4. Deep-fried chicken pieces and tossed them in this signature sauce

## Why "Manchurian"?

Interestingly, the dish has no connection to Manchuria (a region in northeast China). The name was chosen simply because it sounded Chinese and exotic to Indian diners at the time.

## Impact on Cuisine

Chicken Manchurian's creation marked the beginning of a new culinary genre:

- It became the foundation of Indo-Chinese cuisine
- Inspired numerous variations (Gobi Manchurian, Paneer Manchurian, etc.)
- Spread across India and became a staple in Chinese restaurants
- Influenced the development of other Indo-Chinese dishes

## Modern Popularity

Today, Chicken Manchurian is:

- A must-have item on virtually every Indo-Chinese restaurant menu
- Popular street food across India
- Adapted into different regional variations
- Enjoyed globally as a prime example of fusion cuisine

The invention of Chicken Manchurian demonstrates how culinary innovation often happens at the intersection of different food cultures, creating dishes that become beloved classics in their own right.
