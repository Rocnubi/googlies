# Which Country Has the Most Pyramids?

While Egypt is world-famous for its magnificent pyramids, particularly the Great Pyramids of Giza, it surprisingly doesn't hold the record for having the most pyramids. That distinction belongs to Sudan, which boasts over 200 pyramids, nearly twice as many as Egypt's 138 pyramids.

## Sudan's Pyramid Legacy

The ancient Kushite kingdom, located in modern-day Sudan, built most of these pyramids between 751 BC to 350 AD. The majority of Sudan's pyramids are located at three major sites:

1. Meroe: The largest site featuring approximately 40 pyramids
2. Nuri: Home to 19 pyramids
3. El-Kurru: Contains several royal pyramid tombs

## Comparing Sudanese and Egyptian Pyramids

While Sudan has more pyramids numerically, there are notable differences:

- Size: Sudanese pyramids are typically smaller and steeper than Egyptian pyramids
- Age: Most Sudanese pyramids were built later than Egyptian pyramids
- Construction: Built with different architectural styles and techniques
- Preservation: Many Sudanese pyramids are less well-preserved than their Egyptian counterparts

## Other Countries with Pyramids

Several other countries also have significant pyramid structures:

1. Egypt: ~138 pyramids
2. Mexico: Notable Aztec and Mayan pyramids
3. Peru: Step pyramids from various pre-Columbian cultures
4. China: Ancient tomb pyramids
5. Cambodia: Temple pyramids like Angkor Wat
