It's a common misconception that bulls charge at the color red. Let's explore the truth behind this popular belief and understand what really triggers aggressive behavior in bulls.

## The Truth About Bulls and Colors

1. Bulls, like all cattle, are dichromats, meaning they have two-color cone cells in their eyes
2. They cannot distinguish between red and other colors
3. What actually provokes them is the movement of the matador's cape (muleta), not its color

## Scientific Evidence

Research has shown that:
- Bulls are colorblind to red
- They react to movement patterns
- The traditional red cape used in bullfighting could be any color

## What Actually Triggers Bulls?

Bulls become aggressive due to:
1. Threatening movements
2. Perceived threats to their territory
3. Protection of their herd
4. Sudden or erratic motions

## The Origin of the Red Cape Myth

The red cape (muleta) tradition in bullfighting:
- Started in the 18th century
- Red color chosen to mask the blood stains
- Became a traditional symbol
