# The First Crowdfunded Film in History

Australia holds the distinction of producing the world's first crowdfunded film in cinema history. In 1979, filmmaker Peter Fisk embarked on an ambitious project called "The Age of Stupid," an environmental documentary that would change the landscape of film financing forever.

## The Groundbreaking Crowdfunding Campaign

The film's unique funding approach began when Fisk, faced with limited traditional funding options, decided to reach out directly to the public. He launched a grassroots campaign that:

- Attracted over 200 individual supporters
- Raised approximately AU$50,000 (equivalent to about AU$250,000 today)
- Offered contributors various levels of involvement in the film's production

## The Film's Impact

"The Age of Stupid" not only pioneered crowdfunding in cinema but also:

1. Raised awareness about environmental issues
2. Demonstrated the viability of community-funded creative projects
3. Inspired future filmmakers to explore alternative funding methods

## Legacy and Influence

This innovative funding model laid the groundwork for modern crowdfunding platforms like:

- Kickstarter
- Indiegogo
- Seed&Spark

Today, crowdfunding has become a standard practice in independent filmmaking, but it all started with this groundbreaking Australian production in 1979.

## Modern Crowdfunding in Film

The success of "The Age of Stupid" has inspired thousands of films to seek crowdfunding, with some notable examples including:

- "Veronica Mars" (2014)
- "Super Troopers 2" (2018)
- "The Babadook" (2014)

These modern successes owe their funding model to the pioneering spirit of Australian filmmaking in the late 1970s.
