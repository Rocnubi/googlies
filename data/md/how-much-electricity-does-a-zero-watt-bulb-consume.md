# How Much Electricity Does a Zero Watt Bulb Consume?

A zero-watt bulb, despite its misleading name, does consume a small amount of electricity. Let's explore the actual power consumption and how these bulbs work.

## What is a Zero Watt Bulb?

A zero-watt bulb is a small decorative light bulb that uses LED technology to produce a soft glow while consuming minimal power. These bulbs are commonly used as night lights or indicator lamps.

## Actual Power Consumption

1. The typical power consumption ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 watts
2. While marketed as "zero-watt," they do require some electricity to function
3. Annual energy consumption is approximately 1.8 to 4.4 kWh if used continuously

## Cost Implications

1. Operating cost is minimal - usually less than $1 per year
2. Much more efficient than traditional night lights
3. Lifespan typically exceeds 50,000 hours

## Common Applications

- Night lights in hallways or bathrooms
- Indicator lights for electronics
- Decorative lighting in small spaces
- Emergency lighting solutions

## Energy Efficiency Comparison

| Light Type | Power Consumption |
|------------|------------------|
| Zero Watt Bulb | 0.2-0.5W |
| Traditional Night Light | 4-7W |
| LED Night Light | 0.5-1W |

## Benefits

1. Extremely low power consumption
2. Long-lasting performance
3. Cool operation - minimal heat output
4. Safe for continuous operation
5. Environmentally friendly
