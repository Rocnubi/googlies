# What is the Colour of Universe?

The color of the universe is a fascinating scientific discovery that might surprise you. According to astronomers, the universe is actually beige - more specifically, a color dubbed "cosmic latte."

## The Discovery

In 2002, astronomers at Johns Hopkins University made this remarkable discovery while studying the light from over 200,000 galaxies. They wanted to know what color you would see if you could view all the light in the universe at once.

## Understanding Cosmic Latte

The name "cosmic latte" was chosen through a public vote, beating other suggestions like "cappuccino cosmico" and "Big Bang beige." This color represents the average of all light emissions from stars and galaxies throughout the observable universe.

## Why Beige?

The universe appears beige because:
- Most stars emit light in the white-yellow spectrum
- This light gets shifted towards red due to the expansion of the universe
- When combined, these lights create a warm, beige color

## Evolution of Universal Color

Interestingly, the universe hasn't always been this color:
- In its early stages, it was brilliant blue-white
- As older, redder stars formed, it gradually shifted to its current beige
- It will continue to redden as the universe ages

## Scientific Method

The color was determined by:
1. Gathering light data from different galaxies
2. Converting the spectrum into visible light
3. Averaging the results to find the cosmic color

## Significance

This discovery helps us understand:
- The average age of stars in the universe
- The rate of star formation
- The evolution of galaxies over time

## Common Misconceptions

Many people assume the universe is:
- Black (due to the night sky)
- Dark blue (like space photos)
- Pure white (from starlight)

However, these perceptions don't account for the averaged light from all cosmic sources.

## Conclusion

The beige color of the universe reminds us that even the most vast and mysterious aspects of our cosmos can be understood through scientific observation and analysis. While individual areas of space may appear different colors, the average color of all visible light in the universe is a warm, comforting cosmic latte.
